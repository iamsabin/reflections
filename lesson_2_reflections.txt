What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When I initialize a repository on a directory a metadata is created(starting with . folder). It tracks the files that
	you will be changing. I need it to go back to the previous version of my project if any difficult bugs need to be fixed.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is different from the working directory and the repository as it the middle area between them. When we add
	the files to the repository from the working directory, it first gets added(git add) to the staging area. Only after 
	we make commit then the file will be added to the repository for handling.
	It ables to make separate commit in the same directory to different files
