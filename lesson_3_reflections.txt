Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    //Fill in your answer here
    We always don't have the internet access while doing the project. So pulling automatically might not work.
    Also you may not want to pull the changes made on the GitHub and rather working on the same file the change have been
    added. It will gradually populate the commit on your local Git repository.
    And pulling only specific branch you need to is really a great feature.
    It's more controllable.
